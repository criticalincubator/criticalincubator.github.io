            <p class="">Every Sunday, a bunch of people around the globe get together to work on their post-capitalist projects, receive feedback and get inspired. We call these gatherings <a href="https://medium.com/@like_antennas_to_heaven/94256c40a15e">‘Revolution Sunday’</a>. </p><p>At some point, we started to wonder <span style="font-style:italic;">‘what if every day were Revolution Sunday?’</span>. And so the Critical Incubator was born. It’s like Revolution Sunday, but longer, with a team of experts to help you shape your project and grow it out of the idea phase.</p><p>To get the ball rolling and familiarize folks in London with our concept, we will host a hack weekend. The weekend is open to anyone working on projects that foster systemic change, as well as those who'd like to put their talents to good use.</p><p>During the weekend you'll have a chance to expose your project to critical theorists, scientists, software engineers and gain invaluable feedback.
            <p class="">The Hack Weekend takes place <strong>June 2-3, at <a href="https://www.nwspk.com/">Newspeak House</a> in London</strong>.</p>
