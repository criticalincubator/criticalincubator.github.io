            <p class="">Every Sunday, a bunch of people around the globe get together to work on their post-capitalist projects, receive feedback and get inspired. We call these gatherings <a href="https://medium.com/@like_antennas_to_heaven/94256c40a15e">‘Revolution Sunday’</a>. </p><p>At some point, we started to wonder <span style="font-style:italic;">‘what if every day were Revolution Sunday?’</span>. And so the Critical Incubator was born. It’s like Revolution Sunday, but longer, with a team of experts to help you shape your project and grow it out of the idea phase.</p><p>To get the ball rolling and familiarize folks in London with our concept, we will host a hack weekend. The weekend is open to anyone working on projects that foster systemic change, as well as those who'd like to put their talents to good use.</p><p>During the weekend you'll have a chance to expose your project to critical theorists, scientists, software engineers and gain invaluable feedback.
            <p class="">The Hack Weekend takes place <strong>June 2-3, at <a href="https://www.nwspk.com/">Newspeak House</a> in London</strong>.</p>

            <li><h4 class="responsive-h4">Projects</h4>
              <p class="">Anyone with a project that is truly radical can join. That is, a project that when successful will help us move to a post-capitalist future.</p><p>We look for a wide range of initiatives: from thought-provoking artworks, to alternative financial models and from cooperatively run factories, to tools for collective decision-making. We welcome projects that aim to instigate change and last until they achieve their goal, as well as those designed to survive the long haul. Our program is especially suitable for projects that hope to grow out of the idea phase.</p>

           <li><h4 class="responsive-h4">Individuals</h4>
            <p>Aside from projects, we'll also have space for individuals who do not have a project themselves, but are keen to contribute to some else's project.</p>
          </li>
         <li><h4 class="responsive-h4">Advisors</h4>
          <p>Are you a critical thinker, artist, designer, developer, or economist and would you like to spend (part of) the weekend mentoring? Please reach out to us: <a href="advisors@criticalincubator.com">advisors@criticalincubator.com</a></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Participation is free, but we are currently unable to provide travel grants to either participants or advisors. If you have any questions, please send us an email:  <a href="mailto:projects@criticalincubator.com">projects@criticalincubator.com</a></p>
