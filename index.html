            <p class="">We encourage a diversity of economic strategies that together provide an alternative to the hegemony of capitalism. Not through reforms, or a one-off revolution, but by means of what Eugene Holland calls a <strong>slow-motion general strike</strong>: an emphatic disengagement from the current capitalist system in favor of non-hierarchical, self-organizing alternatives. </p><p class=""> Our goal, therefore, is not to foster projects that directly counter the hegemony, but rather those that are entirely non-hegemonic. To paraphrase Holland, these initiatives do not need to be all encompassing, they can be small first steps, as long as their impact is long-lasting and hard to reverse. </p>
