            <p class="">We encourage a diversity of economic strategies that together provide an alternative to the hegemony of capitalism. Not through reforms, or a one-off revolution, but by means of what Eugene Holland calls a <strong>slow-motion general strike</strong>: an emphatic disengagement from the current capitalist system in favor of non-hierarchical, self-organizing alternatives. </p><p class=""> Our goal, therefore, is not to foster projects that directly counter the hegemony, but rather those that are entirely non-hegemonic. To paraphrase Holland, these initiatives do not need to be all encompassing, they can be small first steps, as long as their impact is long-lasting and hard to reverse. </p>

          <p class="py1">We will incubate a wide range of initiatives: from thought-provoking artworks, to alternative financial models and from cooperatively run factories, to tools for collective decision-making. We welcome projects that aim to instigate change and last until they achieve their goal, as well as those designed to survive the long haul. Our program is especially suitable for projects that hope to grow out of the idea phase.</p><p><strong>We now accept proposals for projects to participate in the Radical Incubator Hack Weekend, in London on June 2-3, 2018.

          <p class="">We are actively scouting for an interdiscplinary team of advisors and mentors. These individuals will help shape the participating projects, inform their theories of change and guide them as they endeavour to reach the world. Relevant backgrounds range from critical thinking and science, to engineering, design and art. </p ><p class="">If this sounds like something you might be interested in, don't hesitate to reach out. We aim to kick-off our first cohort in 2019.</p>
